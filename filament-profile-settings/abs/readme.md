>  all ABS, keep in mind this was on the 265 nozzle, not the 240 as I was doing two projects at once. Also I had the ABS in the dehydrator 24 hours in advanced.
Ken says:
> hanks Dylan. I did the same with the ABS, heated for 6 hours. I gave up on ABS today, the nozzle kept ejecting for some weird reason. Going to mic it, get some some measurements and see if I can figure it out before I lose my cool lol- my next post below is what happened today. **265**
