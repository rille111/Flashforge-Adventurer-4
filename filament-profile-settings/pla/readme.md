> I like this. It's good enough details, works with PLA and PLA Pro. It's pretty fast too.

> OK, I got tired of waiting!
When I was beta testing the AD4, we were given a special copy of FP4 that recognised the AD4. It had 4 settings and not just standard. From what I've been told there's no plans to release a Hyper mode as they say there's almost no difference over standard. This Beta copy had;
* Low (faster)
* Standard
* High (Slower)
* Hyper.
> Well, 0.08mm layer height Vs 0.18mm layer height WILL make a difference on some prints. So I fired up the FP4 and the FP5 and transcribed over the Hyper settings as good as I could. It cannot be exact as there's more settings available to tweak in FP5, so it's as "near as". It's for PLA. 
So here's the saved file for you to try and play with. And feed back your findings! For better or worse. And if you make some better tweaks along the way, by all means post them up under files as I have done now. You can be the judge if Hyper makes a difference!
Simply use "Import" when you are in the slicer.

### Comments

* This profile works best with linear supports.
* I got some problems with this with the bottom layer being shifted, the model being moved, resulting in stringing. Maybe because of my PLA - Rickard Robin
